# Background

I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), and a **full-stack Software Engineer**. I have a varied background, having worked most recently within the **financial technology sector**, as an equity specialist at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/europe/). Working within the financial technology sector is where I had come to learn I had a much stronger affinity towards the technological side of my work. Prior to this I completed the [Teach First leadership development program](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/). This involved working in an underperforming academy as a **science teacher for two years**, in order to manage and raise aspirations of the students who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Academically my background is within biological sciences with a **MSc in biochemistry** and **BSc Hons in pharmacology**, both from **King's College London**.

Having a varied professional background, I hope to leverage the different experiences I have gained to support the development of my colleagues, the company and myself.


# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [Pac-Trump VR](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/PacTrumpVR) | Looking to put our learning skills to the test, we jumped into Unity and used an entirely new language (C#) to build a Pac-Man style game in VR with Trumps chasing you in the maze. | 2 weeks | C#, Unity, Android Studio, Google Cardboard SDK, Blender | Unity testrunner |
| [Charlie's Angels Acebook (Facebook)](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/acebook---CharliesAngels) | A team of 4 came together to recreate our own version of Facebook. The inception of the project was inspired by a team member's name (Charlie) and so we played on the design of the whole project around an angel theme. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku | RSpec, Capybara, Travis CI |
| [Kay Cafe](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/Kays-Cafe) | A full-stack app I built which allows a user to enter an order from a cafe's menu, which can then calculate subtotals for receipts.  | 3 days |HTML/CSS, JavaScript | Jasmine  |

# Skills

### Clean code advocate

Makers shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code. Exercising programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, practicing usage of XP Values in group situations to ensure we were on the same wavelength, striking a fine balance between having an efficient and a readable codebase (for yourself as well as for others!) and using TDD/BDD to keep pesky bugs out of the way when that crafted code is pushed to production.

I truly believe in this approach to programming and coding and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.

### Adaptability

I consider myself a highly adaptive individual able to adjust based on the situation.

Once I arrived to start my placement year in China with Goldwind, I found out during my onboarding process that I wasn't suited for the role they needed. I asked my superior if there was a purpose I _could_ fill in the department. Noticing a communication issue with a different member of staff and an international intern, I inquired if it would be appropriate for me to take care of the English speaking staff and escalate if necessary. It turned out to be a fruitful endeavour, creating a role for myself where I could use the skills I had and providing relief for an understaffed IT team.

### Teamwork / Mediation

I'm a true believer of the mantra that a productive team is one that can maintain the ability to work through the highs and the lows.

For my first group project (recreating our rendition of AirBNB), we decided that the purpose of the week was to learn and to try to use new technologies. Morale fluctuated as we underestimated how difficult it would be to wrestle with these tech stacks. Running daily standups and retros, I ensured that our group kept our eyes on the objective we set when we started — our moods always better coming out of them than going in. I believe this helped us to keep focus of what we wanted out of the project whilst maintaining good group cohesion. Ultimately, at the end of the project, we came out deciding that we _did learn_ - hitting our objective.

### Attention to detail

I pride myself in ensuring that my craft is high quality and as error free as can be.

During my group project 'Tasteless Notes', we successfully built our own testing framework but couldn't figure out how to output our pass/fail messages. Initially, we managed to come up with a workaround — but the original issue still surfaced with each message. Combing through our codebase and searching online for information, I noticed we weren't `return`ing the messages; implicitly implied in Ruby, not so in JavaScript. Amending this small keyword displayed our test results beautifully and allowed us to progress with peace of mind knowing we'd tackled the problem correctly.
